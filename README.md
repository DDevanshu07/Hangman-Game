# Hangman-Game
This Python script implements a simple Hangman game where the player has to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters.
How the Code Works
A predefined list of words is stored in words. The program selects one at random.
The chosen word is hidden by underscores (_), representing unguessed letters.
The player has six chances to guess the word before losing.
The player inputs a single letter at a time. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct positions. Otherwise, the number of wrong guesses increases.
The game continues until the player either:
Guesses the entire word â†’ Wins
Uses up all six wrong guesses â†’ Loses
Features and Rules
âœ” Random word selection
âœ” Tracks guessed letters to prevent duplicate inputs
âœ” Validates input (only single letters allowed)
âœ” Displays progress after each guess
âœ” Ends the game when the word is guessed or attempts run out

This is a simple yet fun game that demonstrates basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, lists, and string manipulation. ðŸš€
